# PaL-Linking
**DEPRECATED** (left as an archived repository for reference, to be deleted in a near future). Now the Prêt-à-LLOD linking framework is a collection of Teanga-compatible docker containers and can be found at https://hub.docker.com/u/pretallod, where prefix 'lex' indicates lexicalisation methods and prefix 'link' indicates conceptual and lexical linking methods.

Previously:

Collection of components (submodules) that constitute the Prêt-à-LLOD linking framework
* OTIC (https://gitlab.com/sid_unizar/otic), the "One Time Inverse Consultation" algorithm, as computed for the TIAD baseline.
* CIDER-EM (https://gitlab.com/sid_unizar/cider-em), monolingual and cross-lingual ontology alignment. Evolves the CIDER-CL tool by including the use of word embeddings. 
* Apertium-Lexinfo mapping (https://github.com/sid-unizar/apertium-lexinfo-mapping). Mapping between Apertium's morphosyntactic tags and the LexInfo Ontology.
* Naisc (https://github.com/insight-centre/naisc). Framework for RDF data linking. 
* ontology-lexicalization  (https://github.com/Pret-a-LLOD/ontology-lexicalization). Lexicalization framework that populates ontology (i.e. OntoLexLemon) from lexicon
